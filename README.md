# Daily Scheduler
Backend
Link IOS repo: 

## Summary: 
We are creating a daily scheduler. The user can add events, rank them with either importance or timeline, drag them to another day, or delete them. The user can also change background, block position, size, etc. freely like writing on a piece of paper. When they click on a event, it will open up another UIviewController where they can edit details. Besides the personal schedule, the app also includes Cornell calendar. It will remind the user of each specific event with a certain time in advance.

## Functions:
- “Event”  (Single click: edit detail; Double click: delete or mark as completed: touch hold: drag to next day)
- “Sort”  (time line/ importance)
- “Edit”  (set title, detail, location, etc; add alarm)
